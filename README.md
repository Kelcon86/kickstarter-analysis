# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Analysis was performed on kickstarter crowdfunding data to uncover trends and determine if there are specific factors that make a projects campaign successful in order to help a playwright determine the best approach to her fundraising campaign.

### Background
Louise is an up-and-coming playwright who is looking to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play "Fever". She is estimating a budget of over $10,000, but is hesitant to begin her first crowdfunding campaign and would like an Excel power user to help analyze crowdfunding data.

## Analysis 
Analysis was performed by creating a pivot table and chart to examine the outcome of theater kickstarters based on the launch date as well as the outcome of kickstarters from the play subcategory based on monetary goals. 

### Charts

## Challenges
The main challenge that I encountered was trying to create pivot charts on a Mac, where the chart elements and design tab were not available. After switching to a PC, I was able to complete all of the necessary steps in order to complete the assignment.

## Results
Analysis showed that theater kickstarters that were launched in May and June had the most successful outcomes. Theater kickstarters that were launched in December had the lowest success rate.  
Kickstarters that had a goal greater than 50,000 had a fail rate of 99%. Of the kickstarter projects in the plays subcategory 39% had a goal between 1000 and 4999 and the success rate for those projects was 73%.
